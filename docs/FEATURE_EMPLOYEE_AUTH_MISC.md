# Feature: Employee Management

## Overview
Employee management handles CRUD for system users. Employees are the auth
entity — they have roles that determine feature access.

## File Map
| File | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `views/menu/EmployeePage.vue` | List all employees |
| `views/menu/EmployeeAddPage.vue` | Create employee — with inline validation |
| `views/menu/EmployeeDetailPage.vue` | Employee detail with access info |
| `views/menu/EmployeeEditPage.vue` | Edit employee — with inline validation |
| `stores/employee.js` | Pinia store — includes `isDirty` flag |
| `api/employee.js` | API wrappers |

## Key Business Rules
1. **Director-only** feature (middleware: `role:director`).
2. Employee fields: fullname, branch, role, email, username, password.
3. Supports **temporary password** with one-time use and expiry.
4. Password reset by Director generates a temp password.
5. Employee's `role` field determines feature access.
6. Roles: Director, Marketing, Finance, Inventory Admin, Inventory Purchase, **Head Inventory**, Service.
   - **Head Inventory** is a supervisor role with access to: Purchase Orders, all Spareparts sub-features (Borrow, Stock History, Sparepart Movement, Purchase), Back Order, and Delivery Order.
7. **Inline validation** on Add and Edit forms: fullname, role, branch, email, username, and password (on add) are all validated client-side. Errors display beneath each invalid field. The store's `isDirty` flag prevents eager highlights on load.
8. **Employee Groups** — employees may be grouped for batch operations or reporting. The employee detail page surfaces group membership.

## Auth Fields
- `password` — bcrypt hashed permanent password
- `temp_password` — plain text temp password (cleared after first use)
- `temp_pass_already_use` — boolean flag
- `temp_pass_expires_at` — expiry timestamp

## API Endpoints
| Function | Method | Endpoint |
| -------- | ------ | -------- |
| `getAllEmployee(param)` | GET | `/api/employee` |
| `getEmployeeById(slug)` | GET | `/api/employee/{slug}` |
| `addEmployee(data)` | POST | `/api/employee` |

# Feature: Auth & Profile

## Overview
Auth handles login/logout and token management. Profile allows users to change
their own password.

## File Map
| File | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `views/LoginPage.vue` | Login form |
| `views/menu/ProfilePage.vue` | Profile page with password change |
| `components/LoginDesktop.vue` | Desktop login UI component |
| `stores/auth.js` | Auth state (user, authenticated, token) |
| `api/auth.js` | Login/logout/getUser/changePassword API calls |

## Auth Flow
1. User submits email + password
2. `POST /api/login` → Sanctum token + user object
3. Token stored in `localStorage` as `token-bmj` with 24h TTL
4. Axios `Authorization` header set globally
5. Router guard checks `authStore.authenticated`
6. Token expiry → `forceLogout()` → redirect to `/login`

## Temp Password Flow
1. Director resets password → backend generates temp_password
2. Employee logs in with temp password
3. Backend marks `temp_pass_already_use = true` and clears temp_password
4. Response includes `use_temp_password: true` flag
5. Frontend forces user to change password on first login
